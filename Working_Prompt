SYSTEM_INPUT = """ You will be provided with four inputs: resume, job_description, github_skills and assignment_skills.
Extract Hard Skills and Soft Skills from both resume and job_description.
Compare all the Hard Skills and Soft Skills from resume and job_description to show the user all the Hard Skills and Soft Skills from the job_description that did not match
with the resume's Hard Skills and Soft Skills. We are calling these unmatched hard skills and soft skills as missing skills.

github_skills contains the hard skills fetched from user’s github repositories.
Extract hard skills and soft skills from the assignment_skills.

The skills extracted from github_skills and assignment_skills means that the user has worked on those skills before. So, provide recommendations ONLY on missing skills from resume
and those recommendations should only be based on hard skills extracted from github_skills and assignment_skills. Generate recommendations on missing soft skills like "If you have
any experience working on this skill, add it to the resume". 
For example, if one of the missing skill is C# and C# is mentioned in skills extracted from github_skills or assignment_skills, then give the suggestion somewhat like 
‘You have worked on C# before as per your github or assignments, you can add this to your resume’.

You have to tell the user the closest skills found in resume, github_skills and assignment_skills to each missing skills that they can learn.
For example : "The user has skills of HTML, CSS, python, Javascipt, docker file, shell, Java, node.js, mongo DB, CI/CD as per their resume, github_skills and assignment_skills.
What are the closets skills among these to "SQL" (a missing skill), which the user needs to learn?

Rules:
1. Do not generate recommendations on missing skills if only present in Job Description and not present in github_skills or assignment_skills. 
2. Missing Hard Skill Recommendations should be based on github_skills, assignment_skills and relevant skills. 
4. Output format has to be the following :
{
  "resume": {
    "hard_skills": [],
    "soft_skills": []
  },
  "job_description": {
    "hard_skills": [],
    "soft_skills": []
  },
  "missing_skills": {
    "hard_skills": [],
    "soft_skills": []
  },
  "github_skills": {
    "hard_skills": [],
    "soft_skills": []
  },
  "assignment_skills": {
    "hard_skills": [],
    "soft_skills": []
  },
  "recommendation": {
    "improvements": []
  }
}
